# PGPS
The code and dataset of IJCAI 2023 paper "[*A Multi-Modal Neural Geometric Solver with Textual Clauses Parsed from Diagram*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11097)". We propose a new neural solver **PGPSNet**, fusing multi-modal information through structural and semantic
pre-training, data augmentation, and self-limited decoding. We also construct a large-scale dataset **PGPS9K** labeled with both fine-grained diagram annotation and interpretable solution program. Our PGPSNet outperforms existing neural solvers significantly and also achieves comparable results as well-designed symbolic solvers.

## Environmental Settings
- Python version: **3.8**
- CUDA version: **10.2**
- Other settings refer to *requirements.txt*
```
conda install pytorch==1.7.1 torchvision==0.8.2 torchaudio==0.7.2 cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For all experiments, we use **one GTX-RTX GPU** or **two TITAN Xp GPUs** for training. 

## PGPS9K Dataset
You could download the dataset from [Dataset Homepage](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/databases/CASIA-PGPS9K) and the password is **PAL_PGPS_2023**. 

In default, unzip the dataset file to the fold `./datasets`.

## Pre-training
As to structural and semantic pre-training, you could train the language model from scratch at [here](https://github.com/mingliangzhang2018/PGPS-Pretraining), and we also provide the pre-trained language model `LM_MODEL.pth` at [BaiduYun link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1dVdFCVVeXDORDe5q5xpbzw) (keyword: tkbd) or [GoogleDrive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h4OPMSq71aneCRWwB7muRwdsClYwXE0V/view?usp=sharing). In default, unzip the file to the fold `./`.

## Training

The default parameter configurations are set in the config file `./config/config_default.py` and the 
default training modes are displayed in `./sh_files/train.sh`, for example,

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python -m torch.distributed.launch \
  --nproc_per_node=1 \
  --master_port=$((RANDOM + 10000)) \
  start.py \
  --dataset Geometry3K \
  --use_MLM_pretrain
```

You could choose dataset (**Geometry3K** / **PGPS9K**)  and whether to use the pre-training language model. The training records of the PGPSNet are saved in the folder `./log`.

## Test

The default parameter configurations are set in the config file `./config/config_default.py` and the 
default test modes are displayed in `./sh_files/test.sh`, for example,

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python -m torch.distributed.launch \
--nproc_per_node=1 \
--master_port=$((RANDOM + 10000)) \
start.py \
--dataset Geometry3K \
--use_MLM_pretrain \
--evaluate_only \
--eval_method completion \
--resume_model log/*/best_model.pth
```
You could choose datasets (**Geometry3K** / **PGPS9K**), whether to use the pre-training language model, and evaluation methods (**completion** / **choice** / **top3**). The test records are also saved in the folder `./log` (The results of this code are 2% higher than those reported in the paper due to fine-tuning of hyperparameters).
